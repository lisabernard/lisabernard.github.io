      <h3 class="out" id="prog">Programming in Python</h3>
      
      <p>In December 2016, I finished a <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/index.htm" target="_blank">Python</a> programming course. During that time, I explored the use of basic programming concepts, such as: <a href="https://www.afterhoursprogramming.com/tutorial/python/if-statement/" target="_blank">if statements</a>, <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_functions.htm" target="_blank">functions</a>, <a href="https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2013/08/python-array/" target="_blank">arrays</a>, file input/output and <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_loops.htm" target="_blank">loops</a>. By the end of the course, I had programmed a variety of console-based, graphical and hardware interface applications. Below, I have an embedded battleship application that I programmed as part of my course.</p>
        
      <p>Before I dove into developing my Battleship application, I didn’t know how to use a <a href="https://snakify.org/lessons/two_dimensional_lists_arrays/" target="_blank">2d array</a>. So as I worked on it, I learned how put file input into a 2D array, update the graphics, end the game if the user sinks all the ships or runs out of ammo and tell the user when they’ve sunk a ship (that part was for bonus points).</p> 
        
      <p>If I were to redo this program, I would simplify the code and add in more comments to make it easier to follow. I’d also add more features, such as high scores and a user specified ammo count.</p>
      
      <h3 class="out" id="prog">Programming in C</h3>
      
      <p>A year after learning Python, I took a <a href="https://computer.howstuffworks.com/c1.htm" target="_blank">C</a> programming course. Throughout it, I learned about <a href="https://www.le.ac.uk/users/rjm1/cotter/page_19.htm" target="_blank">data types</a>, <a href="https://study.com/academy/lesson/dynamic-memory-allocation-definition-example.html" target="_blank">memory allocation</a> and <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_structures.htm" target="_blank">structs</a>, in addition to the aformentioned basic programming concepts. By the end of the course, I had programmed numerous console-based applications.</p>
      
      <p>The most advanced C program I’ve developed (so far) is a student data entry program (embedded below).  Before working on this program, I didn’t know how to use file input/output (in C) and memory allocation (<a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/c_function_realloc.htm" target="_blank">realloc</a> and <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/c_function_malloc.htm" target="_blank">malloc</a>) to accommodate for dynamic data. So, as I began to complete the application, I learned about memory allocation, file input/output and <a href="http://www.c4learn.com/c-programming/c-nested-structure/" target="_blank">nested structs</a>.</p>
      
      <p>Overall, I’m happy with how it turned out. Although if I ended up redoing this program, I would use more descriptive variable names to make the code easier to follow.</p>
      
      <h3 class="out" id="fur-prog">Future Programming Ambitions</h3>
      
      <p>Looking to the future, I would like to program more advanced application in Python, C and possibly learn more programming languages such as Javacript and PHP.</p>

    <section id="html" class="white_padding">
      <h3 class="out" id="html">HTML/CSS</h3>
    
      <p>One of the first courses I took as part of the Computer Electronics Program was <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp" target="_blank">HTML</a>/<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_css.asp" target="_blank">CSS</a> based Web Development. During which I learned and experimented with various structural HTML tags and CSS styles. My final project was a web portfolio which I later revamped to create the one you are currently browsing.</p>
      
      <p>In addition to that I started developing a web-based project of my own design. It’s an HTML/CSS “Create Your Own Story Game” which I startED developing in October 2016. Going into it, I didn’t know about HTML and CSS mobile browser compatibility issues or centralization. As a result, I learned about designing mobile websites and more about HTML and CSS in general. If I was to redo it, I would account for easier maintenance. 
        
      <p>Regardless, I plan to keep improving, expanding and maintaining it. The trailer is embedded below and the game's website is <a href="https://thedoomcider.github.io" target="new">https://thedoomcider.github.io</a></p>

    <section id="fusion" class="blue_padding">
      <h3 class="out" id="3d">Fusion 360</h3>
      
      <p>As part of the Computer Electronics program, I learned about both 3D design and 3D printing. Now I can take a 2D sketch containing the measurements and angles of an object. Then use that information to create a scale 3D printable model. Below is a bending jig (a small wire bending tool) that I modeled in <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/students-teachers-educators" target="_blank">Fusion 360</a> which was later 3D printed.</p>
      
      <p>Below is a bending jig (a small wire bending tool) that I modeled in Fusion 360 and later 3D printed. (Embedded STL viewer curtesy of viewstl.com) Prior to modeling this tool, I’d never designed a model nor created a 3d printable one. In the end, I learned how to design and ready model for 3d printing in fusion 360 as well as the challenges that can accompany 3d printing. If I were to redo this model, I would make bigger so I it will be able contain more measurements.</p>
      
      <p>In the future, I would like to make more elaborate models.</p>

    <section id="PCB" class="white_padding"> <!--orignal source code for slideshow from w3schools (later modified by me)-->
      <h3 class="out" id="3d">PCB/Circuit Board Design</h3>
      
      <p>In addition to learning 3D CAD, I took a <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/pcb-basics" targt="_blank">PCB</a> (Printed Circuit Board) design course. During which I was taught how to make schematics, custom footprints and pad stacks as well as layout and route PCBs.</p>
      
      <p>My final project as was a calculator Arduino shield. This was the first assignment that I had to take a schematic created in a different program (<a href="http://kicad-pcb.org/" target="_blank">KiCad</a>) and redo it in <a href="http://www.orcad.com/about/overview" target="_blank">Orcad</a>. So, during the process of creating this shield, I learned about schematical differences between OrCad and KiCad, making custom footprints and padstacks (I only used custom ones to create this board).</p> 
        
      <p>If I were to redo this assignment, I would probably try to use less vias (more as a personal challenge than anything). In the future I would love to make more PCB boards and possibly learn how to use KiCad since it's a free open source program.</p>
