      <h3 class="out" id="prog">Programming in Python and C</h3>
      
      <p>In December 2016, I finished a <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/index.htm" target="_blank">Python</a> programming course. During that time, I explored the use of basic programming concepts, such as: <a href="https://www.afterhoursprogramming.com/tutorial/python/if-statement/" target="_blank">if statements</a>, <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_functions.htm" target="_blank">functions</a>, <a href="https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2013/08/python-array/" target="_blank">arrays</a>, file input/output and <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_loops.htm" target="_blank">loops</a>. By the end of the course, I had programmed a variety of console-based, graphical and hardware interface applications.</p>
      
      <p>A year after learning Python, I took a <a href="https://computer.howstuffworks.com/c1.htm" target="_blank">C</a> programming course. Throughout it, I learned about <a href="https://www.le.ac.uk/users/rjm1/cotter/page_19.htm" target="_blank">data types</a>, <a href="https://study.com/academy/lesson/dynamic-memory-allocation-definition-example.html" target="_blank">memory allocation</a> and <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_structures.htm" target="_blank">structs</a>, in addition to the aforementioned basic programming concepts. By the end of the course, I had programmed numerous console-based applications.</p>
      
      <p>Looking to the future, I would like to program more advanced applications in Python and C. I'd also like learn more programming languages such as JavaScript and PHP. <br><br><a href="worksamples.html#prog">Read More</a></p>

    <section id="html" class="white_padding">
      <h3 class="out" id="html">HTML/CSS</h3>
    
      <p>One of the first courses I took as part of the Computer Electronics Program was <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp" target="_blank">HTML</a>/<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_css.asp" target="_blank">CSS</a> based Web Development. During which I learned and experimented with various HTML tags and CSS styles.</p>
        
      <p>In the future I'd like to continue expanding my Web Development skillset.<br><br><a href="worksamples.html#html">Read More</a></p>

    <section id="fusion" class="blue_padding">
      <h3 class="out" id="3d">Fusion 360</h3>
      
      <p>As part of my System Analysis and Design course, I learned about both 3D design and printing. Now I can take a 2D sketch containing the measurements and angles of an object. Then use that information to create a scale 3D model. Below is a bending jig (a small wire bending tool) which I modeled in <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/students-teachers-educators" target="_blank">Fusion 360</a> and later 3D printed.</p>
      
      <p>In the future, I'd like to make more elaborate models. <br><br><a href="worksamples.html#fusion">Read More</a></p>

    <section id="PCB" class="white_padding"> <!--orignal source code for slideshow from w3schools (later modified by me)-->
      <h3 class="out" id="3d">PCB/Circuit Board Design</h3>
      
      <p>In addition to learning 3D CAD, I took a <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/pcb-basics" targt="_blank">PCB</a> (Printed Circuit Board) design course. In which I was taught how to make schematics, custom footprints and pad stacks as well as layout and route PCBs.</p>
      
      <p>In the future I would love to make more PCB boards. <br><br><a href="worksamples.html#PCB">Read More</a></p>
