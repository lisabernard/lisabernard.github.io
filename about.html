      <img id="about" src="about.png" alt="question mark" />
      
      <p>I am a very dedicated and hard-working individual, but I didn’t start out that way. In fact, I almost failed grade primary. Yes, you read that right.
         I wasn’t doing any of the work, off in my own little world. Fortunately, that quickly changed.</p>
         
      <p>During my time in Elementary school, I won “student of the month” twice. It is an award that recognizes exceptional students. 
         One is awarded to a student in each grade level.</p>
         
      <p>In grade 5, the New Glasgow News hired me to deliver 50 papers each morning before school. I was constantly complemented on my dedication, in fact
         I still have all the Christmas cards I received during my time there. In my grade six graduation celebration, I was awarded the “Eric Doucette Award”
         for Excellence in Math. On the last day of grade six, I was presented a medal for sportsmanship. Earlier that year I signed up for the 800-meter run 
         and came in second last. I was just happy to place.</p>

     <p>I later went on to earn the “medal for exceptional effort” in grade eight. It is awarded once a year to a single student in each grade who is the most
        studious.</p>
        
     <p>I found out about the Quebec school trip in my last year of middle school and it costed $1000 to go. I got another paper route job, this
        time for the weekly news delivering 150 fliers, once a week. Over the course of 4 months, I saved up the money to go.</p>

     <p>I started High School in the IB (International Baccalaureate) program. It taught me some great study and homework habits. In grade 11, I left the
        program and entered the main stream, due to the crushing amount of homework. I would begin nightly, about half an hour after I got home, and spend
        easily three hours straight on it. Since I was taking Karate at the time, I could not afford to procrastinate.</p>
        
     <p>I was thinking about pursing a career in IT. I had a Co-op placement at Staples installing windows, removing hard drives and RAM. I also took Java and
        quickly found, I liked working with hardware over software. I graduated High School with honours, all my teachers loved me.</p>
        
     <p>I then took a year off to save up for school. I got a Job at ToysRus stocking shelfs on the night shift. It was quite a change since unlike most teens,
        I didn’t stay up late. In fact, before my first day, I had never stayed up later than 2:30am. I adapted, and put away enough to resume school.</p>
        
     <p>In September 2016, I started my Computer Electronics Course. Python was one of my first semester courses and while learning if statements,
        my teacher compared them to choices in a 'create your own adventure' game. This originally inspired me to create an Invader Zim ‘choose your
        own story’ game. Three weeks into development, I switch over from Python if statements to individually linked webpages for compatibility sake. 
        Since then, I released a demo version of the game to the public.</p>
